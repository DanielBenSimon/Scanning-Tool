## üìö Description

This **Scanning Tool** is a simple vulnerability scanner and penetration testing script.  
It performs the following operations:

- Pings a target to check if it's up.
- Scans its TCP ports (common or all).
- Detects if port 22 (SSH) is open.
- Performs a simple **bruteforce attack** against the SSH service with a small set of credentials.
- Allows you to connect remotely and execute commands on the compromised machine.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This tool is for educational purposes and should only be used on machines you own or have explicit permission to scan. Unauthorized scanning or attacks may be prohibited by law.**  
> Always follow responsible disclosure guidelines.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

This script is implemented in **Python** (Python 3.x) and utilizes the following libraries:

- [Scapy](https://scapy.net/) for packet scanning
- [Paramiko](http://www.paramiko.org/) for SSH connection

The script will attempt to install missing libraries automatically.  
Make sure you have [Npcap](https://npcap.com) installed (required by Scapy on Windows) and **administrator/root privilege**.
